2. What does scrapper.sh do?
scrapper.sh takes a website (or file path, depending on the flag used) and pulls all of the emails addresses and/or phone numbers.

3. You could write in "at" instead of using the symbol "@" when writing your email address. 


4. One way to circumvent the change is by adding in a check for the word at instead of the symbol.

5. Accessed in calculates how long since a file has been accessed by converting the "last accessed" time to epoch time and subtracting that time from the current time.

6. For dates before January 1, 1970, Unix represents the dates/times as negative numbers (still from Jan 1, 1970)

7. minutes(0-59), hours(0-23), day of month(1-31), month(1-12), day of week (0-7, sunday is 0 and 7)

8. 15 6 7 May tue echo "OMG YES!!!" will get run at 6:15 am on every May 7th that falls on a Tuesday.
